## I'm a Second-Year Computer Science Student at Epitech Barcelona

- 🔭 Currently learning through hands-on projects and exploring new technologies.
- 🌱 I’m continuously learning and expanding my skills in software development.
- 👯 I’m open to collaborating with like-minded developers.
- 🥅 My goal for 2025: Deliver quality projects and grow professionally.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love kitesurfing using the power of the wind to glide across the water and air!


## Projects

### 🐚 Minishell – Project 1

A custom UNIX shell written in C that mimics basic behavior of TCSH.  
It supports built-in commands (`cd`, `env`, `setenv`, etc.), command execution via `PATH`, and advanced features like pipes (`|`), and redirections (`>`, `>>`, `<`).  
This project helped me understand core concepts of UNIX system programming such as process management, piping, and environment handling.

**Technologies used:** C, Makefile, POSIX system calls, UNIX environment

### ✈️ My Radar – Project 2

A real-time 2D air traffic control simulation written in **C**, using the **CSFML** graphics library.  
The program handles aircraft movement, collision detection, and tower protection zones in a dynamic environment. It visually represents air traffic, simulates interactions, and terminates when all aircrafts have landed or been destroyed.

**Objective:** Learn graphics programming, real-time simulations, and complex logic in C.  
**Technologies used:** C, CSFML, Makefile

### 🎮 Slyna's Adventure – Project 3

A 2D platformer developed during a 48-hour Game Jam hosted by **IO Interactive** and **Epitech**.  
I collaborated in a team of 5 as a **developer using Godot (v4.3)**. We built the entire game—including assets and logic—from scratch during the jam.

The game features unique enemies, custom artwork, level progression, and polished player mechanics.  
It was a great opportunity to dive into game development while learning how to collaborate effectively within a small, focused team.

**Objective:** Explore game development fundamentals and teamwork under time pressure.  
**Technologies used:** GDScript, Godot 4.3, Git, Aseprite (for sprite work)
